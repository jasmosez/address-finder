Get Addresses and Lat/Lng for place names via Google Places API

## Overview
The command-line tool was created to programmatically derive addresses and Lat/Lng's for eldercare facilities in NYC, listed as having elevated mortality rates from COVID-19 by the city Dept. of Health. All this in order to map those locations in relation to other demographic info.

It was written to be easily adapted for future address and geolocation lookup.
